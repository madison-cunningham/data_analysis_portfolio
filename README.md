# Madison Cunningham - Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, I'm Maddie! I am a current graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Statistics form the  University of Massachusetts Lowell,where I also completed a B.S. in Mathematics. I am currently a research assistant for the Zuckerberg College of Health Sciences at UMass Lowell. The research project concerns the assessment of high school football concussions by monitoring head impacts. I assist in data cleanup of raw data, perform and interpret statistical analyses, and create figures to visualize data. Previously, I worked as the business intelligence intern for the Major League Soccer team FC Cincinnati. My responsibilities included cleaning, merging, and transforming large datasets for modeling and analyses. 


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in data analytics.
